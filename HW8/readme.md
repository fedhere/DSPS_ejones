I used the techniques we learned in class on monday to try to make a better plot from one of the HW plots I did for HW 7
I figured it would be acceptable data since we already used it.

Here is my embedded plot of temperature vs number of molecules with MCMC and r^2 fits:

GOod plot but let me point out that we generally plot models with lines, to indicate that they are models and can be calculated everywhere. A blue line would have done the trick for r^2
