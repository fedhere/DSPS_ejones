## Review of the Graphics:

### Points of improvement

1- You have used the letter 'n' in the legend as well as in the axis label, which is kind of confusing at first sight.

2- The marker size selection is making the graph a bit hard to read the values, especially the starting values at low temperature. 

3- The title is a bit misleading, incomplete information given to the viewer to interpret the graph.

## Quality of The Plot:

The color selection and the transprancy of markers make the graph very nice, also the fontsize of legends and axis labels are 
equal and also perfectly selected to be read easily.

I am not sure I agree with 1 : the symbol used is the same to represent the same quantity, which is correct. I would have recommanded though to plot R^2 with a line, since we generally plot models with lines since they can be calculated everywhere (continuously)

Howeve, the review is generally ok, you gound both a quality and 3 imrpovements. Except for not including the plot in the readme, which was a requirement
